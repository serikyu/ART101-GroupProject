				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<!--Style this-->
				<p style="font-size: 18px;"> Welcome to Hot Slugs Near You! A silly name, we know LOL. But we hope 
					that this website can act as a fun way for UCSC Students, and Santa 
					Cruz residents alike, to share their banana slugs! It's quite simple 
					really. Find a slug? Take a pic and post it to our site! Add a fun 
					caption and make sure to include where you spotted your slug. Your post 
					will appear on our site's map as a marker that other users can click 
					on, view, and comment! 
				</p>  
			</div>
		
			<!--Tutorial-->
			<h1>Tutorial</h1>
			<div class="minor-section-columned">
				<!--Style this-->
				<!-- NOTE: Make Tutorial steps appear as columns and NOT rows! (Unless thats a bad idea...)-->
				<!--Style ALL h3 Headers for this page-->
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Step 1:</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Press start on the homepage to begin! You probably already 
					figured this part out. From there, take a look at our map! 
					Click and drag on the map to move around and view other areas.
					</P>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h3>Step 2:</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Go ahead and find a slug marker on the map. When you click it, ta-da! 
					Another user's post will pop-up. From there, you can see the user's 
					profile name, the image of the slug they found, where they found it, 
					and other details. You can even comment on the user's post! Click the 
					"X" in the top right to exit.
					</P>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h3>Step 3:</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Now it's time to make your own post! Scroll past the map on the main page 
					and find the "I Found A Slug" button near the bottom. Clicking here will 
					prompt a pop-up for you to create your own post! Exit any time through "X" 
					and minimize it for later using the "__". 
					</P>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h3>Step 4:</h3>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Be sure to include the image of your slug, where it was found, and any other 
					interesting details you think are post-worthy (Ex: Was wet, on a tree, under 
					a rock, etc.)! Click Submit and you're done! Feel free to revisit your post 
					anytime and respond to people's comments! [Note: Posts are automatically removed 
					from the site after 3 months.]

				<p style="font-size: 16px;">Hello! My name's Sophie (She/Hers) and I was in charge of a lot of the
					HTML elements for this site, as well as its 
					base JavaScript functionality. I had no coding experience 
					beyond Python before entering this class. This project defintely wasn't easy
					as a beginner so I'm pretty proud of how far I've come. In terms of my passions
					I'm actually a creative writer! I'm hoping to be a game writer or narrative designer one day!

				<p style="font-size: 16px;">Hello hello! I'm Elio (they/he), a digital artist hoping to make art for games, and I contributed to 
					the CSS styling of the website! I also did some proofreading and debugging for the HTML and JavaScript 
					code that our site runs on. I had very little coding experience (I only learned Python in my senior year 
					of high school) prior to taking this class, so I've had a lot of fun learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS this quarter :)

					being a tattoo artist, but I also love games and design! I mainly contributed to the CSS styling of this site, but I also worked with the HTML
					a little bit. I didn't have much programming experience before this outside of a couple robotics classes in high school, and I had a lot of fun
					expanding my knowledge and seeing what else I could do with coding!
