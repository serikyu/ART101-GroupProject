				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<!--Style this-->
				<p> Welcome to Hot Slugs Near You! A silly name, we know LOL. But we hope 
					that this website can act as a fun way for UCSC Students, and Santa 
					Cruz residents alike, to share their banna slugs! It's quite simple 
					really. Find a slug? Take a pic and post it to our site! Add a fun 
					caption and make sure to include where you spotted your slug. Your post 
					will appear on our site's map as a marker that other users can click 
					on, view, and comment! 
				</p>

				<h2>Tutorial</h2>

				<!-- NOTE: Make Tutorial steps appear as columns and NOT rows! (Unless thats a bad idea...)-->
				<!--Style ALL h3 Headers for this page-->
				<h3>Step 1:</h3>
				<P>Press start on the homepage to begin! You probably already 
					figured this part out. From there, take a look at our map! 
					Click and drag on the map to move around and view other areas.
				</P>

				<h3>Step 2:</h3>
				<P>Go ahead and click on a marker! Find a slug marker on the map 
					and click it. Ta-da! Another user's post will pop-up. From there, 
					you can see the user's profile name, the image of the slug they found, 
					where it was found, and other details/information. You can even 
					comment on the user's post! Click the "X" in the top right to exit.
				</P>

				<h3>Step 3:</h3>
				<P>Now it's time to make your own post! Scroll past the map on the main page 
					and find the "I Found A Slug" button. Clicking here will prompt a pop-up for
					you to create your own post! Exit any time through "X" and 
					minimize it for later using the "__". 
				</P>

				<h3>Step 4:</h3>
				<P>Be sure to include the image of your slug, where it was found, and any other 
					interesting details you think are post worthy (Ex: Was wet, on a tree, under 
					a rock, etc.)! Click Submit and you're done! Feel free to revisit your post 
					anytime and respond to people's comments! [Note: Posts are automatically removed 
					from the site after 3 months.]
				</P>

			<P>Hello! My name's Sophie and I was in charge of a lot of the
				HTML elements for this site, as well as it's 
				base JavaScript functionality. I had no coding experience, 
				beyond Python, before entering the classs this project was for 
				so I'm pretty proud of how far I've come. I'm actually a creative 
				writer, hoping to be a game writer or narrative designer one day!
