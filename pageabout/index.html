				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<!--Style this-->
				<p style="font-size: 18px;"> Welcome to Hot Slugs Near You!!! A silly name, we know LOL. But we hope 
					that this website can act as a fun way for UCSC Students, and Santa 
					Cruz residents alike, to share their banana slugs! It's quite simple 
					really. Find a slug? Take a pic and post it to our site! Add a fun 
					caption and make sure to include where you spotted your slug. Your post 
					will appear on our site's map as a marker that other users can click 
					on, view, and comment! 
				</p>

			<h1>Tutorial</h1>
			<div class="minor-section-columned">
				<!--Style this-->
				<!-- NOTE: Make Tutorial steps appear as columns and NOT rows! (Unless thats a bad idea...)-->
				<!--Style ALL h3 Headers for this page-->
				<div class="column">
					<h2>Step 1:</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Press start on the homepage to begin! You probably already 
					figured this part out. From there, take a look at our Slug Locator! 
					Click and drag on the map to move around and view other areas.
					</P>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h2>Step 2:</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Go ahead and find a slug marker on the map. When you click it, ta-da! 
					Another user's post will pop-up. From there, you can see the user's 
					profile name, the image of the slug they found, where they found it, 
					and other details.
					</P>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h2>Step 3:</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Now it's time to make your own post! Scroll past the map on the main page 
					and find the "I Found A Slug" button near the bottom. Clicking here will 
					prompt a pop-up for you to create your own post!
					</P>
				</div>

				<div class="column">
					<h2>Step 4:</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 18px;">Be sure to include the image of your slug, where it was found, and any other 
					interesting details you think are post-worthy (Ex: was wet, on a tree, under 
					a rock, etc.)! Click Submit and you're done! 
					</P>

				<p style="font-size: 16px;">Hello! My name's Sophie (She/Hers) and I was in charge of a lot of the
					HTML elements for this site, as well as its 
					base JavaScript functionality. I had no coding experience 
					beyond Python before entering this class. This project defintely wasn't easy
					as a beginner so I'm pretty proud of how far I've come. In terms of my passions
					I'm actually a creative writer! I'm hoping to be a game writer or narrative designer one day!

				<p style="font-size: 16px;">Hello hello! I'm Elio (they/he), a digital artist hoping to make art for games, and I contributed to 
					the CSS styling of the website! I also did some proofreading and debugging for the HTML and JavaScript 
					code that our site runs on. I had very little coding experience (I only learned Python in my senior year 
					of high school) prior to taking this class, so I've had a lot of fun learning HTML, JavaScript, and CSS this quarter :)

				<p style="font-size: 16px;">Hey! I'm Rhys (she/they), and I'm a digital and traditional artist! I mainly just draw silly little cartoons and illustrations and am working towards
					being a tattoo artist, but I also love games and design! I mainly contributed to the CSS styling of this site, but I also worked with the HTML
					a little bit. I didn't have much programming experience before this outside of a couple robotics classes in high school, and I had a lot of fun
					expanding my knowledge and seeing what else I could do with coding!
